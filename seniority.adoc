# _Seniority_ por Nivel

En muchas empresas se habla de distintos niveles de _seniority_. Sin embargo es un concepto muy ambigüo ya que varía entre cada empresa. 
Para poder estandarizar un poco, se detallará lo que se espera de un profesional en cada nivel. Basado según los criterios de 
la empresa https://www.ockam.io/[Ockam Network].

Es la responsabilidad de la empresa y del equipo de trabajo 
proveer un ambiente donde cada indiviuo este empoderado para ser y crecer al nivel mundial (_world-class_) en su rol
y habilitarlos para alcanzar más de lo que pensaban posible para ellos mismos.

Esta guía pretende ayudar para alinear las expectativas y crear un marco de trabajo donde se tenga un lenguaje en común
para describir los caminos de desarollo profesional y permitir conversaciones honestas. 

Se debe usar como una guía de auto evaluación. Primero hay que definir si el cargo es para un miembro del equipo de desarollo (ejemplo: _Engineer_)
o es para un miembro del equipo de gestión (_CTO_). No se espera que un candidato cumpla con todos las características en la tabla a cabalidad. La tabla es una 
guía y una forma de facilitar la conversación. Es probable y totalmente válido, que un ingeniero _Senior_ (Nivel 5) pueda tener algunas cualidades nivel 4 y otras nivel 6.

También considerar que una oferta de trabajo para Nivel 6 (_Arquitect_) pudiera ser perfectamente viable para un Nivel 3/4 bien sólido. Ya que
las tareas, exigencias, expectativas y perfil de desarollo profesional puede ser adaptado para las necesidades de cada candidato y puesto de trabajo.

*Note:*

It is assumed that an engineer at a high level would still focus on all of the attributes associated with levels 
that they’ve already surpassed in their career.  For example, even though "Learning" is a Level 1 | 2 focus, 
everyone should be on a virtuous learning cycle, even at Level 8.

The converse is  also true. A lower level engineer is likely to check several boxes at levels 1 or 2 
above their current level. This is particularly true on our small team. Everyone should have stretch tasks as part of their role.


## Anti-Patterns

*Levels 1-2:*

Poor code quality. Not self-motivated; needs someone to tell them what to do next. Constantly veers into the weeds. More inclined to blame-complain than roll up sleeves. General helplessness. Disregards team process.

*Levels 3-4:*

Disappears into projects that don’t matter to the business. Fails to identify or communicate big roadblocks. Us-vs-them attitude. Continually underestimates timelines. Doesn’t take operational excellence seriously. Solutions are more complicated than necessary.

*Levels 5:*

Arrogant jerk. Doesn’t delegate. Always says "yes" and suffers burn-out. Jumps into execution without careful consideration. Lets details slip through the cracks. Fails to raise awareness of projects at risk or people-problems. Doesn’t follow new technologies or industry trends. Thinks that some work is ‘beneath them’.

*Levels 6-8:*

Over-emphasis on scaling or high availability far beyond business needs. Spends too much time chasing the newest "shiny" technology simply to satisfy ego. Doesn’t collaborate or ask questions. Condescending. Has a “pet” agenda. Pisses off senior leadership.
